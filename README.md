<h1>Mon OS is a solo project made by me, to make an alternative for vscode.dev</h1>
<p1>It is fully open source, has NO bloat, and has the monaco as the frontend!</p1>
<p1> It is also a game engine but i didnt work on that yet, it will become an IDE and a game engine</p1>
<p1> just not right now sadly :(</p1>
<p1> If you want to support the project by contributing it or making a fork and making your own stuff, go right ahead :D</p1>
<p1> This is a FOSS program, so do whatever you want</p1>
