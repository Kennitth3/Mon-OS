        # Mon OS is a solo project made by me, to make an alternative for vscode.dev
        It is fully open source, has NO bloat, and has the monaco as the frontend!
        It is also a game engine but i didnt work on that yet, it will become an IDE and a game engine
        just not right now sadly :(
        If you want to support the project by contributing it or making a fork and making your own stuff, go right ahead :D
        This is a FOSS program, so do whatever you want
